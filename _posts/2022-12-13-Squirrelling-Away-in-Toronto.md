## Squirrelling Away in Toronto

I'm nuts about squirrels. 

Actually, I love any creature that can skirt rooftop and fence in the semi-futile attempt to find a home amongst our concrete monstrosities and banalities of brickwork.

I know they're pests, but as with other problem species like possums, foxes and rabbits, they also have some amazing physiological and behavioural adaptations that allow them to make the most of our ever-encroaching urban sprawl and ever-dwindling wildlife corridors. 


This blog is devoted to studying, conserving and celebrating different animal species (even the unpopular ones). One of the ways that I love to celebrate animals is by drawing and painting them, so you'll find little illustrations dotted throughout this blog (I hope).
